ebusfsm provides c++ classes and tools to communicate via ebus.

The main part of this library is a 'finite state machine' (FSM) which will be run as a seperate
thread. Via ebus device the FSM handle all the communication to other ebus participant. The FSM
provides the ability to interact with ebus as master (active) or slave (passive) member.

  API/Interface classes:

  * EbusCommon:   Basic functions like CRC calculation.

  * EbusDevice:   Provides the hardware access for network or serial ebus devices.

  * EbusSequence: All kind of ebus messages are sequences of individual hexadecimal characters.
                  A 'EbusSequence' can hold only one (full) ebus message.

  * EbusFSM:      Represents the FSM it selfs which can be act as passive or active ebus
                  participant.

  * EbusProcess:  A base class for derivation as a process thread for the coupling of FSM to
                  active / passive Ebus message handling

  * IEbusLogger:  Is a simple logger interface for internal messages of FSM.
